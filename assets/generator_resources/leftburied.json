They also have the Upper Hand on Stat Checks to see through illusions and other mind affecting magics.",
    "Far Travelled": "Many Gastropodian societies highly value training in numbers and conversions, with their most skilled citizens becoming expert record keepers and administrators. Most can spout off complex calculations quickly enough that they must know what they're talking about.<br>Gastropods have 2 Gastropod Grip each Adventuring Day, that can only be used for guile, calculation or skill-based Exertion.",
    "Deathless Nature": "Lacking a connection to the mortal coil, Lamenters do not need to breathe, eat or rest, suffering no penalties for going without. However, they cannot recover Vigour by resting, and are wholly unaffected by Holy Advancements. Their Grip recovery is unaffected.",
    "Undying": "It is difficult to truly end Lamenters, but fatal experiences still strain them. When reduced to 0 Vigour, Lamenters fall Unconscious. Upon awakening, they regain all lost Vigour. <br>If killed by an Injury received this way or if their form is completely destroyed, they are permanently killed.",
    "Necrosis": "Despite their continued grasp on existence, their bodies are not immune to death's natural processes. Lamenters smell slightly putrid—though not as much as mundane corpses. Some wear perfume to mask the stench.<br>Sensitively nosed creatures can always detect their necrotic flesh however, which may change their reaction, attacking them more or less than living Cryptdiggers.",
    "Abominations": "As undead beings, Lamenters face all kinds of prejudices from the living and the divine. Lamenters are Against the Odds on all Checks to convince those aware of their nature of their good intentions. Additionally, Lamenters cannot receive Holy Advancement's benefits. ",
    "Helpful for Some, Hindrance for Others": "Most Small Folk stand around 3' which has its benefits and disadvantages. Small Folk have the Upper Hand on Stat Checks where being their size is advantageous (hiding, crawling into tight spaces, avoiding notice) but are Against the Odds on Stat Checks requiring more than 3' in height (lifting, reaching, feats of height and strength). Clever environmental interaction or narration may circumvent this.",
    "Happy Go Lucky": "Small Folk are legendary for being jammy gits. Start each Adventuring Day by rolling a die. This may replace a single die roll at any point in the day, whoever rolls, even after the result is determined. ",
    "In A Hole In The Ground": "An army marches on its feet, but Small Folk march on their stomachs. The quality of a Small Folk's Recovery only takes into account the quantity and quality of food available. Warmth, comfort and security don't matter, as long as the food is good and plentiful.",
    "Tiny Hands": "Small Folk don't have the right build for certain weapons. They cannot use Heavy Weapons and must wield Hand Weapons and Long Weapons two handed, without gaining any benefits for doing so. Weapons wielded by other characters or monsters may be of a different weight class for Small Folk.",
    "Mechanical-Body": "As mechanical beings of wood, wire and ceramic, Automatons do not remember their need to breathe, eat or rest, so suffer no penalties for going without. However, they cannot recover Grip or Vigour by resting or from Holy Advancements.",
    "Automaton-Mind": "Within their new bodies, most Automatons do not remember their fear of worldly terrors. They have the Upper Hand on all Grip Checks. However, when an encounter triggers memories of their lost humanity, they alone might require a Grip Check (without the Upper Hand).",
    "Field Repairs": "Awakened Automata are forced to become skilled in self-repair or they're soon destroyed by wear and tear. Once per Adventuring Day, with 1 hour of uninterrupted work and appropriate tools, the Automaton can self-repair by passing a Wit Check to regain D3 Vigour. If failed, they recover only 1 Vigour. Working over 8 hours grants the Upper Hand. If assisted by another creature for the full period, the assistant can roll the check instead."
