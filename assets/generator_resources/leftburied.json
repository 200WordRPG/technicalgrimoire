An entire society working towards a single task: digging towards the centre of the earth on some mindless holy crusade flee the moon. Every Dwarf away from their city, whether an exile, radical or criminal is called ‘Clanless’. An outcast. They allege it's hard to spot madness in another species, which is probably why so many end up with us—and so many of us with them.<br>As weird as they are, beneath the grubs and beard hair and constant lectures about the beautiful shades of 'bonegrey' and 'rivergrey', there's no one I would rather have beside me in a cave than those grudge-born idiots.",

    "Elf": {
      "Description": "There was an elf who joined us once: Their-Prose-Be-The-Darting-Of-Blade. They always denied their competence—claiming to be a scholar and a poet, not a warrior—but they were an artist with the blade nonetheless. They could hold the wizards in debate, the fighters in duels and outsinging most of the bloody bards. It clicked when they recalled when they hearing the news of the Battle of Hamlet Hill—making them at least 150 years old. That's the thing with Elves: they live long enough to become good at everything. Shame the bloody bastard never did any work nor got their hands dirty.<br>I've heard stories, though, of Elves going into the pits and snapping. That lot are aesthetes, they don't just appreciate beauty, they worship it. If they find something down there that doesn't match their conception of the world, they might just break and never return.",

    "Gastropodian": {
      "Description": "Streesh drives a hard bargain. All Gastropodians do. Way I hear it, most Gastropodians have been to enough places they know exactly what something’s worth and how to convince you to pay just a little more—or them a little less. Great with numbers though, and drink too. You know Greeg? Big bear of a man? Streesh is half his size and drank him under the table before winning three games a’ cards.<br>That’s the thing about them, I think. No idea where they’re from or where they’ve been or what they’re capable of. It's their main advantage: surprise.",

      "Description": "Old Scapula over there? Yeah, he’s dead. Yes, his face is a skull. What? Never seen a Lamenter before?<br>Ahhh, well… Scaps’ been dead over four hundred years—if his memory serves! I don’t rightly suspect it meself, but there you go. He’s mostly like you or I, apart from when he died, he just didn’t. Happens once in a month of Blue-moons, Scholar tells us. Jormund reckons some uppity necromancer rased his corpse before getting offed by some hero, leaving Scapula to his own devices. Who can say? Scapula can’t any more.<br>Well yeah, he was there, but I can’t remember what I ate for breakfast some days, so how’s he supposed to remember what happened a’fore our grandad’s grandads was born? I met a couple other Lamenters, the same way all. They forget, just like us, only they have a lot more to forget.<br>Fresh ones even struggle. Met one insisting they hadn’t actually died—even when presented with both their severed legs. Turned violent that one did—had to put it down. Messy business. Long and messy. Very hard ta’ kill something already dead—probably explains old Scapula’s success with the company, ey?",

Dab hand with a knife and a nose keener than any other, that fierce fool was always welcome alongside us in the Crypt.<br>We had to put her in charge of the food. She was always eating, they always are. I don't know how they put it away. Most are less than three and a bit feet tall, child sized, but one could outeat most grown men. Then they’d go right back to snacking on sweetmeats and croissants and little chunks of cheese carried in their pockets.<br>They ain't too far away from Goblins either. Common ancestry, Scholar says. Personally, I think they're the same stock—nature and nurture and all that. Sarge says Goblins are Small Folk who got hungry and started eating each other. That's pretty much what Mattoc looked like after going feral.",

We let ‘em join anyway. Escapees and rebels often flee north, and from what I’ve heard, they have a hard time getting jobs. No one wants to employ a soul in a box. The ones I’ve worked with are pretty darn good in a Crypt. They don’t scare easy. They don’t use up our rations, and can keep watch all night! They’re still creepy though.",

Your character can add 2 more types of potion to their list each time they take Concoctionist.<br>Drinking a Potion takes an action and 3 points of Grip and will give the benefits of an Adaptation for a single combat (or five minutes if used out of combat).<br>Once you have drank the potion, it is gone and cannot be used again.<br>The Grip loss represents the negative effect of the potion's chemistry ravaging your mind and body.",

They immediately gain a random Insanity or a random Corruption.<br>These two new Advancements do not count towards the sum of advancements needed to unlock other Advancement tiers, such as Arcane, Devious, Holy or Martial Advancements.<br>Eldritch Pacts always return to bite characters who take them. Their patrons may demand additional favours from their servants, which may be confusing and difficult, but must always be met.

These consequences include, but are not limited to, additional Consequences, loss of Vigour or Grip, reduction in stats, removal of the Advancements granted by the Pact or even death.",

The attack ALWAYS has the Upper Hand and deals damage equal to the damage die result multiplied by the cost in Grip the character spent. The damage counts as magical for any relevant Advancements and Adaptations.<br>Fire and Lightning Strange can be taken multiple times to gain the ability to attack with multiple types of magical element. The character may then choose which element to use each time they take an action to use it.",
    "The Holy Song of War": "The character can spend an action and a point of Grip to grant a number of allies up to their Will the Song of War. Each ally can use the Song of War once before the end of the combat to apply the Upper Hand to an Attack Roll or Stat Check.",

    "I See Truth In The Stars": "At the end of an adventuring day, choose a number of Grip points to spend on receiving cryptic visions from dreams, stargazing or bone throwing.

    "Shadow Glamours": "The character can spend an action and a point of Grip to either:<br>- Gain the Upper Hand on a Wit check to hide.<br>- Make all enemies Against the Odds on observation checks to spot them for one round.<br>- Alter visual aspects of the character’s cosmetic appearance, such as clothing, facial detail or hair. These changes are visual only and will thus react inconsistently with the other senses. These changes will last for the next minute.",
    "Spirits of the Beyond": "The character can spend an action and a point of Grip to reanimate a corpse to serve them until the end of the combat with the below stats.",
    "Tough as Nails": "The character gains an additional point of Vigour for each Advancement they have. When Injured, spend a Grip point to roll two dice on the Injury table and choose the result you prefer.",
