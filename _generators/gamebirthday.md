A way for the community to celebrate games that have already been released.

create a google calender to hold the birthdays
Connect to the api, add simple event
display the calender on the page (just the week?)
user form to add new game birthdays
  name
  email
  game name
  game link
  game birthday
  game descr (limit?)
events repeat every year, all day long
how do users edit events? Add a game with the same name, no because then you can troll other games.
maybe add a contact email in case of an issue; recruit others to help maintain it?

create a twitter bot that announces birthdays!
