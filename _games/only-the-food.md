Horror adventure inspired by a nightmare I once had. Way darker and grosser than anything else I've written (or probably ever will write), so handle with care.

A Sci-Fi horror adventure for the [Dread system](/david/extremely-interesting-role-playing-games#dread). Dread is perfect for running a horror/thriller game, and uses a Jenga tower instead of dice to keep the tension high! Players are stranded on a damaged ship with a broken AI, and must survive long enough to repair their vessel and try to escape with their lives.

 * [Creepy, atmospheric audio](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1VmqucXbk79hvqvR7vnnFC15Bs8aC5JMS) for the broken AI. Brilliantly produced by Robert Freeman.
 * [**Maps, audio recordings, character sheets, and more stuff**](http://www.supernovembergames.com/tomes-of-tomes/2016/10/1/dread-only-the-food-and-aliens) made by Tomer Gurantz. Makes it even easier to jump into a game and draw in your players.
 * A handy [questionnaire](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0kJHmPZ9hLOMVlYWmtWSV9BcUk/view) to help flesh out the characters. Created by [Richard Allred](https://plus.google.com/u/0/110758153649579874722/posts).
