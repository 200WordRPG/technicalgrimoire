A Tabletop RPG mud-crawl adventure. It’s like a hex-crawl but every freaking mile is a dirty, grimy, sweaty trial. Written by [Joe Banner](https://joebanner.co.uk/) using the elegant “Tunnel Goons” rules.

Marsh Goons is about tromping through a bizarre marsh, encountering/surviving the locals, and lots (and lots) of mud. A dozen new creatures and locations, powerful NPCs, and streamlined mechanics make this an easy choice for quick adventure. A standalone sequel to [Bone Marshes](/bone-marshes).
