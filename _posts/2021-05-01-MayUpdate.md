I'm a weird writer.

I know I'd get more views if I wrote more regular blog posts. But a lot of the work that I enjoy doesn't lend itself well to a blog post format. So...here's a blog post. Finally. About all the stuff I've been working on.

## Reprint Kickstarter

WHAT?? I planned, launched, funded, overfunded, and completed an [entire Kickstarter Project](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/technicalgrimoire/rpg-printing-spree) without posting anytihng on the blog?

Yeah...sorry. Told you I was a bad writer. Weired, I mean. Weird is a better word.

Luckily the project went well! We funded 6 books and we're on schedule to get them printed and delivered by June. 

**Bone Marshes** and **Tempered Legacy** will be back in stock very soon. WOOOO!

## Bone Marshes + Marsh Goons

[Bone Marshes](/bone-marshes) is getting a MAJOR content update that will include everything from Marsh Goons (a sequel adventure by [Joe Banner](https://joebanner.co.uk/)). I updated the Bone Marshes page to include character sheets and generators from both parts.

If you already own the Bone Marshes PDF, you get the expanded version for free! WHOOO!

## Altar of Shredded Memories

Created in partnership with [Lucas Rolim](https://twitter.com/rolimllucas) and my wife, Lauren Schirduan. We submitted it to the [TroikaFest Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/troikafest-2021).

This was a ton of fun to work on, and features some fun mapping rules and skill mechanics. Grab it for free and give it shot!

## Patreon Explosions Update

During 2020 I launched a Patreon to give my favorite [200 Word RPG Entries](https://200wordrpg.github.io/) some fancy layout. 

Now all 10 games live on a [new page](/patreon) with easier access. They're all free, and they're all cool. Enjoy!

## Generator Updates

The [Tempered Legacy weapon generator](/tempered-legacy) has a new feature: Search Bar! The Tempered Weapon database is infinite and endless. Simply enter a weapon name from any source and you'll get a shiny result. This also makes it easier to save and load weapons across devices. Happy Searching!

The [Troika Generator](/troikagenerator), [Best Left Buried](leftburiedgenerator), and [Stygian Library](stygiangenerator) generators also got fresh coats of paint. Tons of minor optimizations and fixes that took many hours of my life...but don't really fit into a blog post, haha!

## More to come!

After the Kickstarter project is complete I've got a bunch of stuff coming soon.

- Blog posts about making your own generators, convention display updates, and some more game reviews.
- [RIPE](/ripe) is still under construction; I've got a bunch of rad artists aged 60+ who are contributing their work. So pumped to show it off soon!
- [Lowcountry Crawl](lowcountry-crawl) is getting a re-print, and update, and some sequels. This time with a team of black writers and artists who will take the zine in an exciting new direction. GET HYPE!
- And some other things that aren't ready to share yet.  

Thanks for putting up with the awkward silences on this website. I hope to remedy that situation, but who knows? To make sure you don't miss out on any news, be sure to sign up for the [Newsletter](/)!
