I attended a convention in 2019, another in early 2020, and felt like I was really hitting my stride. Then quarantine happened, and my convention aspirations dwindled for a while.

But now I'm back! And ready with a newly upgraded booth setup. This is part of an ongoing series about convention stuff. Previous posts here:

 - [Version 1](/david/2019/10/convention-breakdown)
 - [Version 2](/david/2020/02/ConventionV2)

Conventions are a uniquely exciting experience from a vendor perspective, and I cannot WAIT to get back in the groove. While online communities and stores are incredible, there's something magical about seeing someone get excited about your book right in front of your eyes. I love that feeling.

## Version 3

The big upgrade is a pop-up banner and a printed foam-board sign. Having more stuff behind the table gives me more space to put books on main display. And I added a bunch more freebies for people to choose from.

However there are still a few things I'm not sure about.

 - **Keep the box?** The box from Version 2 did add multiple levels and made the display a little more eye-catching. But it doesn't fit with my new black-background aesthetic. Might still be worth keeping? I dunno.
 - **Change the Freebies sign?** It's got the right colors, but something more professional might fit better with my other signage. But I kinda like how friendly it is; draws attention to it.
 - **Better way to display Freebies?** The display looks a little cluttered; with the different pages stacked so tightly. But maybe that's good? Like customers can see all the different choices at once?

Either way, I'm happy with the new setup. I'll be attending [ConCarolinas 2021](https://concarolinas.org/) in June, so if you're in the area, stop by and say "hi!"

I'll update this blog post after the event is over with a report of how things went.
