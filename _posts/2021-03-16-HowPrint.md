> I'm like that co-worker who drives an old junker. When you ask them, "How do you keep that thing running?", the advice you get will be useful...but probably no replacement for hiring a real mechanic.

You [finished your zine](/david/2019/11/JalopyZine), layout looks good, the [art is beautiful](/david/2019/08/JalopyResources), and now you want to get some printed copies on store shelves.

Turns out, printing books is expensive! Like...really expensive. So let's look at our options for printing books.

## Option 1: Print & Assemble at home

This option is really----what?

Ben **who**? Ultan's **WHAT**?!

_paper rustling sound effect_

## Option Whatever someone already did this

Yeah, turns out Ben Laurence of Ultan's Door [wrote a great blog post](http://maziriansgarden.blogspot.com/2020/01/so-you-want-to-make-zine-printing.html) about your options for printing zines and books. 

So...instead of copy-pasting everything he wrote let's talk about money. Because in addition to choosing HOW you print your zines, it's important to decide how you'll pay for it.

## Option 1: Out of Pocket

I know, I know. "David, if I could afford to print a bunch of books I wouldn't have clicked on your weird website." But hear me out.

We think of a "print run" as thousands and thousands of books. But if you're a small creator that can be overwhelming and a risky investment. What if the books don't sell?

In that case, let's try for a narrower scope: say 200 books. That's been a good starter amount for my stuff.

Yes, smaller print runs cost more per book, BUT it's less cost over-all. And if you have good margins then you can roll your profits into future, larger print runs
