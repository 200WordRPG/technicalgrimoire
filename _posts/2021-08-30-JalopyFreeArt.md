> I'm like that co-worker who drives an old junker. When you ask them, "How do you keep that thing running?", the advice you get will be useful...but probably no replacement for hiring a real mechanic.

In [another Jalopy article](/david/2019/08/JalopyResources) I listed a bunch of resources for fonts, maps, and artwork. But that public domain art requires some work to make it look nice. Here's my process for finding, altering, and including public domain artwork in my games.

Here's some examples from [Lowcountry Crawl](lowcountry-crawl) and [Tempered Legacy](tempered-legacy).

If you hate these examples, probably don't take my advice.

## Step 0: Expectations

> "Wow! Free artwork! Why isn't everyone just using free stuff? I guess all those artists are out of a job, lol!" - Me, in 2014

Before we dive in, it's important to realize the tradeoffs we're making here.

**Trading Money for Time.** You will spend hours and hours combing through images trying to find something that might fit your text and theme. There are a LOT of images out there, and 99% of them won't work at all. Even the best image search can only go so far.

**Trading Vision for Compromise.** Be prepared to make lots of compromises and interpret images creatively. "I need a picture of an erupting volcano with a scary castle on its slope". No. You will not find that. BUT you might be able to change your text to a "dormant volcano" and use [this one](https://www.flickr.com/photos/britishlibrary/11205154945), or [this one](https://www.flickr.com/photos/britishlibrary/11306688484), or [this one](https://www.flickr.com/photos/britishlibrary/11072087176).

Are those as cool as the erupting volcano castle? No, of course not. But that's why it's free!

**Trading Modern Expectations with Old History.** A lot of public domain art is over 100 years old. "I need a picture of a feirce dwarf fighting 2 dragons and a wizard." No. You will not find that. Remember that Lord of the Rings is only 50 years old, published in 1954. Before then we thought of Elves as tiny fairies. Wait--I've been informed that the year 2000 was actually TWENTY years ago. What?! *hyperventilating noises*

Same with certain genres. If you wanted a laser gun, you'll be relying on what people in the ~~1900s~~ 1920s thought a laser gun would look like. Which is...[not much](https://www.flickr.com/search/?user_id=12403504%40N02&view_all=1&text=laser%20gun).

**Trading Diversity for Dated Steriotypes.** This one has been my biggest dealbreaker for a lot of things. If you value diverse characters in your game then you have a LOT of work cut out for you. "I need a picture of a female pirate captain." No. You will not find that. BUT you might be able to alter your text and explain how your captain wears [many different disguises](https://www.flickr.com/photos/britishlibrary/11053345634) to [appear as a man](https://www.flickr.com/photos/britishlibrary/12458980783).

Also, as a word of warning, always dig a little deeper into the context of an image. Flickr might show you a cool picture of an [Nuehr Chief](https://www.flickr.com/photos/britishlibrary/11203034193) who has SO much swagger it's unreal, but that same book has [this photo](https://www.flickr.com/photos/britishlibrary/11207268943) of phrenology examples. Ugh. 

Basically if you go anywhere near this stuff, **please hire a consultant** or historian or SOMETHING. Just because it's free doesn't mean you should use it.

Now that we've talked about some of the compromises you'll be making, here's my process for getting the most value from public domain art as possible. I'm actually going through these steps as I type it up, so I have no idea how things will turn out. Fingers crossed!

## Step 1: Examine the Content

Let's say we're making a zine about weird magicians. I already talked about the basics of [making a zine with Affinity](/david/2019/11/JalopyZine) so we can jump right int.

"Amphizard the Secretious" will be the focus of our next two-page spread. He's half frog, half wizard, and super duper gross. We've got some text about Amphizard (how he loves turning people into flies and then eating them), a list of spells (and fly-related recipes), and maybe some quotes ("I like turning people into flies and then eating them"). You get the idea.

I purposefully wrote Amphizard to draw on a bunch of old magic tropes. Something weirder or more modern could take MUCH longer to find images for. Amphizard himself still might be difficult to find a picture of. Sure we can probably find a picture of a generic wizard, but our original vision of a half-frog-half-man is going to be tricky. Likewise we can find pictures of flies and people pretty easily, but we need some kind of magical flair or effect.

Oh well, time to start looking.

## Step 1: Start Looking

My [Jalopy resources](/david/2019/08/JalopyResources) are a good place to start, but there are dozens and dozens of places to find public domain art. For simplicity, all of our examples will assumme that we're searching through [Flickr's British Library catalogue](https://www.flickr.com/photos/britishlibrary/). Their photo-tagging is excellent and the scans are generally high resolution.

Let's start with the basics and search the British Library for ["wizard"](https://www.flickr.com/search/?user_id=12403504%40N02&view_all=1&text=wizard). A few interesting choices:

 - [Friendly Wizard](https://www.flickr.com/photos/britishlibrary/11139917623). WAY too friendly looking for Amphizard. We could re-write Amphizard to be a friendly kind of wizard who sees frog-magic as a non-lethal option.
 - [Silly Wizard](https://www.flickr.com/photos/britishlibrary/11238638173). Hmm...we could re-write Amphizard to be more silly. Maybe he still turns people into frogs, but they just turn back to normal after a few days.
 - [Telescope wizards](https://www.flickr.com/photos/britishlibrary/11264668164). This is kind of a cool image, but the quality is low and it doesn't really fit Amphizard.
 - [FROG WIZARD!](https://www.flickr.com/photos/britishlibrary/11229886075). Okay wow...I actually did not expect this. This goes against my previous points, but somethig you DO get lucky. This wizard is pretty damn perfect. Of course he's fully human; not particularly weird looking. But we have this incredible pose of him casting a spell on a frog.

Here we can pull a cool trick and scroll down a bit to click on ["View all the illustrations found in this publication"](https://www.flickr.com/photos/britishlibrary/tags/sysnum001433100). Maybe there will be more pictures of this same character. Whoa, this book is huge. I don't see any other pictures of the wizard. Or anything else that really fits our theme.

Just out of curiosity, let's search for ["old man"](https://www.flickr.com/search/?user_id=12403504%40N02&view_all=1&text=old%20man) and see if we get any weirder looking guys. Nothing. Let's try just ["old"](https://www.flickr.com/search/?user_id=12403504%40N02&view_all=1&text=old).

 - [Melty Wizard](https://www.flickr.com/photos/britishlibrary/11301307354). This is a cool, weird, gross old wizard. I dig it. 
 - [Santa Wizard](https://www.flickr.com/photos/britishlibrary/11195180743). Too jolly.
 - [Harp Wizard](https://www.flickr.com/photos/britishlibrary/11133197506). I like the big beard, but it isn't very weird.

Okay, I think we've done enough looking. We have our picture of Amphizard. 

## Step 2: Compromise

Time to re-write our text to better fit the image. 

 - Amphizard is no longer half-man-half-frog. He's just an older looking man.
 - Instead of turning people into flies and eating them, he turns people into frogs and eats them! We tweak the recipes a bit, and change some descriptions.

We still have an evil wizard who turns people into something else and then cooks with them. Same vibe, just not as gross. Oh well.


Now let's find one or two good images of frogs to include as decoration and drive the theme home.

 - [Chonky Boi](https://www.flickr.com/photos/britishlibrary/11306698433). A big detailed image. Slightly weird perspective, and the background is a little distracting.
 - [Frogmen](https://www.flickr.com/photos/britishlibrary/11265311783). Okay, this is weird on first glance but...since people are turned into frogs, maybe this is a good way to show that something magical is happening?
 - [Dark Frog](https://www.flickr.com/photos/britishlibrary/11024515353). Nice dark colors on this one, makes it stand out.
 - [Better Frogmen](https://www.flickr.com/photos/britishlibrary/11149817095). Oooh, yeah, I like how these are walking like people. It's creepy and weird. Perfect.
 - [Faded Frog](https://www.flickr.com/photos/britishlibrary/11006038064). This is a low contrast image that looks weirdly flat. Not great.

So now we have our [wizard](https://www.flickr.com/photos/britishlibrary/11229886075) and we have some creepy [human-like frogs](https://www.flickr.com/photos/britishlibrary/11149817095). This is actually coming together.

## Step 3: Cleanup

It's tempting to download the images, crop them, and slap them into the zine.
