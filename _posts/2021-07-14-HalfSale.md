**Now is your chance to buy [all my games at 50% off](/games)**!

This sale lasts through the weekend:

- Get Print copies + PDFs on [Spear Witch](https://spearwitch.com/search?type=product&q=schirduan).
- Or you can grab all the PDFs on [Itch.io](https://itch.io/s/53703/50-off-everything).
- [DTRPG sales](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/browse/pub/6897/Technical-Grimoire-Games) will go live first thing Thursday morning!

_Mythic Mortals printed copies are not on sale because DriveThruRPG charges INSANE prices for their printed books. So sorry about that._

## Why? You hate sales!

True; they're a giant headache and usually not worth the trouble.

But [ABIDE](/abide) has been a huge drain on my gaming budget. For a few reasons:

 - We're working with some older artists who expect physical rates (art gallery prices). They have done incredible work, and it's well worth it, but definitely pricier than I'm used to.
 - A plethera of consultants! Older consultants, disability consultants, fiction writers, other designers; this book is growing from a huge team of people with all kinds of diverse backgrounds and skills. And their hard work deserves compensation.

Normally I handle all the text myself, pay for some artwork, and then rely on Kickstarter to provide the additional funds.

But I want ABIDE to be special from the start, and it's been worth the cost and extra effort to make sure we're on a solid base before we even go to Kickstarter.

If you're curious about what we've got so far, you can [grab the playtest PDF here](/abide).

## Wasn't there something else?

![lowcountry-simple.png](/images/lowcountry-simple.png)

Yes! [Lowcountry Crawl 1.5](https://www.technicalgrimoire.com/david/2021/06/LCCReturnsRIPE) is nearly text-complete and will go to layout soon. We're hoping to have print copies available well before Christmas of this year. 

But it's yet another drain on my limited game budget.
