This is a rambly, introspective post. If you're looking for something meatier to read, check out the newest version of [Tempered Legacy](https://technicalgrimoire.com/tempered-legacy). It's a work-in-progress and where most of my creative energy has gone recently.

This blog post is going to be a summary of my experiences with the OSR, and a discussion of why you might want to join this strange, exciting community. Also some light criticism.

## The Journey So Far

Here's a quick summary of a bunch of blog posts I've written before, and where I'm coming from. Don't read them, they're terrible.

[**Journey into OSR**](/david/2016/09/my-journey-into-osr) in which I talk about my progression of tastes in RPGs.
 - My first experience playing D&D and GMing was 4th edition, and I burned myself out trying to memorize all the rules and prep. 
 - Then Dungeon World taught me about improvisational GMing. The game used it's rules to drive the story forward and offload some of the creativity on the players making my job WAY easier. "Fail Forward" changed how I GM and how I prep for games.
 - Over the last two years I've driften into "Old School Roleplaying" or OSR for short.

[**Dungeon Crawl System**](/david/2017/07/dungeon-crawl-system) compares a lot of OSR rulesystems with what I'm looking for/hoping for. 

[**Blogpocalypse**](/david/2018/10/blogpocalypse) talks about the fall of G+, and my embracing the blogging community. This also marks a point when I baean dedicating more time to blogging and writing.

[**Corrupt Bones**](/david/2019/02/corruptBones) is about some toxic individuals in the OSR comunity, as well as the responsibility we have to build a better, more inclusive commmunty. [**SWORDDREAM Interviews**](/david/2019/06/SWORDDREAM) discusses some first steps and community goals to make that happen.

## What is OSR?

Assuming you took my advice and didn't read the blog posts above, I'll post my own summary of the OSR here, from first impression to current knowledge:

**Impression**: The Old School Renaissance community is a bunch of cranky neckbeards who refuse to grow out of the 80s. They make long blogposts over meaningless rule changes and promote a hostile "GM vs Players" mentality. It's the gaming equivalent of people who hate Star Wars movies that aren't from the original trilogy. Games change, people. Move on. Embrace new ideas.

**After 2 years in this space**: The OSR community is a group of indie bloggers and creators who thrive on excessive collaboration and the exchange of ideas. Many of their games explore the early world of RPGs when rules were simpler and influences were classic sci-fi/fantasy. The mantra "Rulings, not Rules" encourages a lot of GM innovation and simplification rather than tactical simulation.

Before we continue, I'm going to be comparing 4 different games to demonstrate the advantages of the OSR mindset:

- **Dungeons & Dragons 5e** - D&D is a juggernaut of RPGs, and where 99% of players and GMs get started. The 5th edition almost wants to be OSR-ish, which is really weird. 4th edition was my first RPG, but I've never played 5e.
- **Pathfinder** - A spin-off of D&D that prizes complex character creation and in-depth tactical combat. I've only played one game of Pathfinder, and I hated it.
- **Story Games** - Powered by the Apocalypse games, mostly. These games emulate story beats and narrative structures rather than simulating a world. I love these games, and still play them every chance I get.
- [**Knave**](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/250888/Knave) - My current OSR game of choice. Not only are the rules dirt simple, but it's mostly compatible with a bunch of OSR content.

Please know that I'm not insulting or talking bad about these games. If I describe my favorite ice cream flavor as "Chocolate because it's not vanilla", that doesn't mean I don't like vanilla. Or that I wont want vanilla tomorrow. 

Play what you like. But if you haven't tried an OSR game before, here are some reasons you might want to:

### OSR games are easy to play. 

On the player's side, character creation is often random or extremely simple. No analysis paralysis or 400 pages of research required. There are no "broken" characters in OSR games because all characters are kidna broken. 

I've seen some point this out as a failing: "But I LIKE meticulously crafting characters across 3 books and 6 hours." You do you, but if I'm trying to get my cousins to play a game, or my wife, or my work friends; then 6 hours and 400 pages is a big ask. 

OSR games are a great introduction to RPGs for newer players.

### OSR games reduce prep through adventures and simple rules. 

On the GM side, OSR games have a lot of neat innovations to make our jobs easier. This, honestly, was 99% of the appeal for me. I HATE prep; it totally kills my energy and joy for RPGs. And no one knows how to prep like the OSR.

Simple rules help, but the oft-repeated mantra of "Rulings over Rules" is the secret weapon of OSR games. It basically means this:

> If you don't know the rule to cover a situation, then it's better to make something up then to spend time referencing the gamebook.

Not only does this speed up play, but it also makes the game your own. Maybe you came up with some weird drowning rules because you didn't memorize them. That's cool! You can always change it later if your players didn't like it or if it didn't work well.

The experience at the table is more important than what's in the rulebook. This emphasis on creative content over published material is also why OSR bloggers are so rabid: They're already making stuff up all the time. Of course they would want to share it with others and hear about other cool ideas.

### OSR games make death meaningful and impactful. 

Less heroic. Death is scary and unpredictable. It's scary. And usually best avoided.

### The OSR is a diverse, welcoming community that wants your brain.

From random character generation you play someone randomly created.

OSR games are also more accessible. No licenses, blogs, low barrier to entry.
