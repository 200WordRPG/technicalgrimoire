Whenever I go to work out the gym I....I grab the barbells by the neck and listen to.....

Okay, I lied, this isn't about a physical workout. Instead it's my programming/writing/design music. It will grow over time and probably bloat to uselessness eventually. 

But I hope you find something new and excited to add to your own playlists.

## I'm Weird

I don't use a music streaming service. I like to OWN things, even if it's just a collection of digital files. Thus I post links to purchase the music for yourself. I can't say if these songs are available on spondora or Google Apple Tunes or whatever.

Bandcamp is my favorite music site. It lets me directly support the creators and searching through tags lets me find weird, cool stuff. When I find an album I like I click all the tags related to it and find more EVEN WEIRDER cool stuff.

*Word of Warning: Bandcamp lets you listen to something a few times, and then prompts you to buy it. If you want to hear it again, consider dropping a few bucks on music you'll enjoy forever.*

## Introductions
These are not my favorite, but are fairly popular and broadly considered to be good examples of their genres. 

**Electronic** - I don't really know what "electronic" means as a genre, so I just use it to refer to anything that doesn't fit the below categories. "**Aspire** by she" is my best example of Electronic music I like.

Something between a pop rock album and a remix. I'm a HUGE sucker for weird vocals, and this album has it in spades. 

*2. Music Like This* is my favorite, and probably the closest I'll ever get to dubstep.

**Video Game Bleep-Bloops** - Mostly older games with simple notes and melodies. Anything that has strong bleep-bloops. And remxies of bleep-bloops. "**Shovel Knight** by Jake Kaufman is a great example of quality bleep-bloops.

Shovel Knight has consistently impressed me with its soundtrack. Just amazing stuff.

**Synthwave** - Modern electronic music with 80's style and sounds. Here is a good breakdown on the [origins of synthwave](https://ironskullet.com/2018/03/01/what-is-synthwave-2018-edition/). "**Together Through Time** by TWRP" is my primary example.

I discovered TWRP through Ninja Sex Party (another great band if you don't mind foul language). A lot of their songs have minimal vocals with some awesome mood changes throughout each song. 

*3. Phantom Racer* is my favorite. Caveat: the [music video for Starlight Brigade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9Q3i5w6-Ug) is the most amazing, gorgeous thing...watch it RIGHT NOW!

<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 200px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1801894464/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="http://twrp.bandcamp.com/album/together-through-time">Together Through Time by TWRP</a></iframe>

**Remixes** - Popular music and/or soundbytes that have been put to electronic music. This music might have blended lyrics that don't distract me from my work. **Symphony of Science** by MelodySheep is my top pick.

Not only does it make me feel smart to listen to, it also sparks my curiousity to learn more about the subjects covered and listen to the talks the sound bytes come from. 

*15. Nature of Sound* is my favorite track.

**Chill** - I always think of it as coffeeshop music. Good chill music fades into the background so I don't even notice it. Great for when I want to focus on something while relaxing. I also really like the crackles and pops to give it a lo-fi feel. "**Zelda and Chill** by Mikel & GameChops" is my best pick for chill beats.

It would be a mistake to call this "video game music" because it takes the original tracks and slows them down to a nice doze. Still recognizable, of course, but not overt.

<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 200px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2495407455/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="http://music.gamechops.com/album/zelda-chill">Zelda &amp; Chill by Mikel &amp; GameChops</a></iframe>

Thus ends the "first picks" section and now I get to share the good/weird stuff with you!

## More Synthwave
Now we get to the good stuff! Here are my top picks:

**Girls on Bikes** by OSC

I love how happy and cheerful these tracks are. I can picture myself riding a skateboard down the street on the way to meet some friends at the local mall.

<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 200px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1322113618/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="http://music.businesscasual.biz/album/girls-on-bikes">Girls On Bikes by OSC</a></iframe>

**Invaders** by Hollywood Burns

A soundtrack to the best X-files rip-off movie never made. A combination of moody theramin warbles mixed with heart-thumping beats. 

*8. Came to Annihilate* is my favorite.

<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 200px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=4126728191/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="http://blood-music.bandcamp.com/album/invaders">Invaders by Hollywood Burns</a></iframe>

**CULTPOP** by Robots with Rayguns

This is a weird one. Each track feels like it's from a different band. The twisted vocals and beats are just so engaging. If you like this, you'll like more weird stuff on this list.

<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 200px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=832938387/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="http://robotswithrayguns.bandcamp.com/album/cultpop">CULTPOP by Robots With Rayguns</a></iframe>

**Amplifier** by Lost Years

I don't think there's one track that really stands out; they're all so engaging and smooth. If "Invaders" above was too weird, then this is probably more your speed.

<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 200px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=465507607/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="http://rossocorsarecords.bandcamp.com/album/amplifier">Amplifier by Lost Years</a></iframe>

## More Chiptunes

**Better Than Reality** by LukHash

This album has some incredible blends of rock, synthwave, and chiptunes. But it goes in the chiptunes section because the bleep-bloops are on fleek. _Right? That's what the kids are saying these days, right?_

<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 200px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=86943995/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="http://lukhash.bandcamp.com/album/better-than-reality">BETTER THAN REALITY by LukHash</a></iframe>

**Crypt of the Necrodancer** by Danny Baranowsky

This is a video game about fighting monsters on the beat. It is a base requirement that the soundtrack be engaging and fast-paced. And it does not disappoint.

_If you like this album, there are a dozen remixes of it; same beats with new twists._

<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 200px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=441884888/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="http://dbsoundworks.bandcamp.com/album/crypt-of-the-necrodancer-ost">Crypt of the Necrodancer OST by Danny Baranowsky</a></iframe>
