Like many people I struggle to find validation and "success" among this little community. I want my games to sell well, I want people to praise my genius, and I want to bring joy to strangers through my creations. You can judge the value of a game by the number of people who play it or talk about it. Games that aren't played don't matter.

This is a lie, of course. **Your RPG is AWESOME, because you made it. The act of creation brought you joy, and that's enough.**

This article is a rambling outpouring of my soul; about what games mean to me, and what I want to see more of in the RPG community, with a little sadness at the end. _No, really, I am just gonna keep typing until I-_

## Finally Discover a Passion

Until recently (well...the past 4-5 years or so) I considered myself an "uncreative person". I'm good at math, science, computers, all the nerdy stuff. Traditional creative outlets (drawing, writing, dancing, music, etc) I found frustrating or boring. So much solo practice was required. So much time spent by yourself desperately trying to stay motivated and focused.

I have always loved video games, but the thought of creating one depressed me. The fun stuff (levels, powers, characters, enemies) are seperated by hundreds of hours of difficult programming and often tedious work. No thanks.

But then I discovered tabletop RPGs. 

I volunteered to be the Game Master. I had to come up with an adventure for my players. Characters, environments, items, monsters; all had to come from my brain and entertain my friends. And it did! No one was more shocked than I. After those first few sessions, I was hooked. I needed more RPGs in my life. 

I discovered a community of like-minded people on Google+ (RIP). They weren't just playing RPGs, but they were making their own! These were (mostly) normal people coming up with ideas and sharing them for feedback. They weren't brilliant programmers with millions of dollars. 

Kickstarter provided the money, print on demand was easy to use, and the internet allowed for cheap marketing. Anyone could do this. Anyone could make a game. *I* could make a game. 

RPGs finally gave me the creative outlet I've sought for so long. And any time someone else finds the same joy, I am so excited for them and what they're doing.

## Community Expression

Role-playing games are powerful. They _require_ community, foster community, and thrive within a community. You can draw and paint and play music by yourself. But it's difficult (nigh impossible) to make an RPG by yourself.

In a recent [Backstory podcast](http://oneshotpodcast.com/backstory/27-d-vincent-and-meguey-baker/) episode Meguey Baker said (about 46 mins in):

"The value of game design that it's totally 100% oh my god legit okay to make a game for your play group that never gets played anywhere else."

That resonated with me so strongly. 

I don't personally enjoy all games, and I wouldn't even say that every game objectively "good". Everything has the potential for improvement, and constrictive criticism is vital to improving your designs. 

However I do believe that RPGs are "AWESOME" in that they inspire awe. Someone had an idea, distilled that idea into rules/mechanics, and was able to communicate that idea to a group of strangers. That is AWESOME!

## The Reason for my rambling

This article comes from a place of disappointment, anger, and heartbreak. The creator of a hateful, anonymous blog was recently revealed to be someone I knew. They were one of the first people to encourage me and cheer me on. And I was horrified to realize that they held such bile within their heart. 

The blog has since been deleted, but I wanted to preserve this awful sentiment so that I can respond to it. **From the blog:** 

"A LOT (we’re talking like 99.9repeatingFOREVER%) of RPG stuff sucks (even the stuff by big companies with a staff and budget and everything) but people don’t say it BECAUSE:

 - They think you should ONLY EVER say nice things even about bad things.
 - They’re friends with the guy (either in real life or online and/or maybe think the guy can boost the signal for their crappy game shit later).
 - They’re afraid that the guy and/or the guy’s friends will harass them/try to ruin their life.
 - (If you make your own game things) They’re afraid the guy and/or the guy’s friends will lie about their stuff/make them look bad.
 - They don’t want to waste the time writing a post pointing it out and maybe having to argue back and forth with retards online.

So that’s why I started this blog: tired of stupid shit getting undeserved praise and people not even daring to say something slightly negative about the stuff they still like despite the bad parts."

_David Guyll's contributions to my games and this website have been removed. I refuse to support anyone who would act this way._

## So that's why I wrote this article

Because I rebuke this sentiment and all who share it. I am not afraid of giving helpful feedback or constructive criticism. I am not afraid of harassment. I'm not afraid of people lying about me or making me look bad (I do plenty of that on my own, thank you very much!). And obviously I'm not afraid of wasting time.

What I'm afraid of is that people like this asshole will discourage someone from playing and making games. I choose to celebrate the act of game design, regardless of its popularity or "quality". 

In fact that's the purpose of the [200 Word RPG Challenge](https://200wordrpg.github.io/). We encourage EVERYONE to make a role-playing game because we believe that the act of creating an RPG allows for a unique expression that other mediums lack. 

We need more people making games, playing games, and talking about games. 

- If you have never played an RPG, ping me and I'll get you into a game.
- If you've never made a game, I hope you'll join the [200 Word RPG Challenge](https://200wordrpg.github.io/) this year (coming in October!).
- And if you do make games, I hope you'll continue to be supportive of others. Give helpful feedback, support your fellow creators, and continue to make cool stuff with others.
