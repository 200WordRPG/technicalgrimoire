In [**episode one**](/david/2020/08/TechnicalTea1) we looked at three of the six [categories of tea](https://teaepicure.com/tea-classification/). 
 - **The green tea** was rather bitter (but that could have been because I over-steeped it)
 - **The black tea** was smooth and bold
 - **The white tea** was...not good. It smelled nice, but tasted bland and empty.
 
My plan was to then try the other three categories: Oolong, Yellow, and Fermented. But my tea stash is running low, and I don't have any yellow or oolong teas! AUGH!

So instead we're going to spend today's session taking a look at three of my personal favorites!

## Disclaimer

Thanks to colonialism tea is a surprisingly tricky subject to talk about. I'm a pasty white guy who is NOT qualified to speak on the history or culture of the teas I enjoy. I'm hoping these reviews will encourage me to grow in my understanding.

I call these brewings "ceremonies" because I am a moron. I am not a [tea master](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_tea_ceremony), I'm just enjoying the quiet experience of making tea via the [gongfu brewing](https://www.reddit.com/r/tea/wiki/faq/gongfucha#wiki_an_introduction_to_gongfu_tea) brewing method. If you're curious I highly recommend looking up some official ceremonies online; they are beautiful!

## Today's Picks

All three of today's teas come from [Elden Street Tea Shop](https://www.eldenstreettea.com/) which was recommended to me by a friend.

 - [**Emperor Pu'erh**](https://www.eldenstreettea.com/teas.html?store-page=Emperor-Puerh-Aged-4-years-p190919414) - Aged 4 years. Elemental earthly with chestnut notes. Smooth finish.
 - **Organic Lapsang** - A smooth crisp character with the remarkable and heady aroma of a pine and oak wood fire. Cup tends bright with reddish hues. (this is also from Elden Street, but I couldn't find a link on their site)
 - [**Organic Earl Grey**](https://www.eldenstreettea.com/teas.html?store-page=Organic-Earl-Grey-p190939469) - A classic tea that will never go out of style. Ceylon black tea blended with bergamot and blue cornflowers. A great pairing with milk and sugar.
 
This review will be a little different. I already drink and enjoy these teas every day! This will be less of a review and more of a chance to ramble about teas I like and some of the history behind them.

In addition I got this fancy new tea tray to celebrate the podcast! It's WAY easier cleanup than the big one I use for group ceremonies.
