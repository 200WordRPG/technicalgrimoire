Clink received a spanish version and it is GORGEOUS! [**Get it here**](https://www.elrefugioeditorial.com/tienda/clink). Let's take a closer look...

## A Brief History

Clink began as an evolution of [Kintsugi](/kintsugi) and was inspired by [Vow of Honor](https://www.sigilstonepublishing.com/vow-of-honor-rpg/). I had planned to release Clink as a free PDF like [Jedi Wushu](/david/my-creations/jedi-wushu), but Ben Dutter of [Sigil Stone Publishing](https://www.sigilstonepublishing.com/) expressed an interest in it.

Within a few months Ben had taken a messy little google doc and fleshed it out to a beautiful game. [Per Folmer](https://www.artstation.com/shrimpskimps) stepped in and added their technicolor artwork. Per's artwork really transformed the game into something special. Many of the Westerns coming out at that time were drab, brown muddy colors, but Clink had bright purples, reds, and greens that made the entire thing pop.

A few years later, [El Refugio Editorial](https://www.elrefugioeditorial.com/) emailed me about publishing a Spanish translation of Clink. I sent them the original print files, and figured they would run it through Google Translate, tweak the layout, and print it. No big deal.

Boy, was I wrong!

## This is a luxurious upgrade

My first clue that this wasn't a simple copy-translate-paste job was the coins. I've had people requesting Clink coins for YEARS but never had the resources to make it happen. But El Refugio not only printed coins, they printed BEAUTIFUL, heavy-duty coins that make the most glorious clinking noises.

Not to mention all the pretty extras: bookmarks, a reference sheet, little stamped cloth baggies for the coins...

It's incredible. And we haven't even gotten to the actual book yet. Which is way bigger?!

## The Actual Book

Not only has the text been espanded, the layout re-imagined, and the size of the book increased...but it has over three TIMES the amount of art as the English release. My favorite addition is a new adventure inspired by the Mandalorian, which always seemed like a perfect fit for Clink's rules.

I'm am completely blown away. El Refugio has exceeded every expectation and made a book even more beautiful than the original.

## But...I don't speak Spanish!

Now you have a good reason to learn. I wrote this blog post for three reasons:

1. El Refugio deserves to be celebrated for their incredible work. I know translations can be difficult and scary, but El Refugio did everything right and were a joy to work with.
2. I'm excited! More people will get to play Clink!
3. The English version of Clink was recently reprinted, and is currently [on sale for 50% off](https://www.technicalgrimoire.com/david/2021/07/HalfSale)!

Perhaps if we'll lucky those beautiful coins will be sold seperately someday. I know a few English cowpokes who'd shoot their foot for a bag of those coins.

 - Buy the Spanish version of Clink [from El Refugio here](https://www.elrefugioeditorial.com/clink).
 - You can find the [English version here](/clink).

Thanks for all your support, and don't lose your creed while you're flipping coins and earning scars!
