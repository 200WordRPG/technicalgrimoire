## Upcoming Convention

Continuing my [convention adventures](/david/2019/10/Convention-Breakdown) I'll be attending the upcoming [Captain's Comics Expo](https://captainscomicexpo.com/) Feb 22nd and 23rd. Come say hi!

I tried to upgrade my setup a little. Maybe you'lld find these notes helpful for your own booth ideas. Some of the feedback I got from the last convention:

*My old Setup from last October*

- **More Variety.** It needs something. a new level or something eye-catching. I didn't get many complaints, but several people agreed it was missing something. PIZZAZ!
- **"Do you play D&D?"** Include some kind of indicator to draw people who already know about RPGs, since they're my target audience.
- **Clarify my pitch.** By the end of the day I had it down pat, but the first few hours I stumbled over my words and said something different every time. Next time I’ll have something memorized.
- **Less words on the table.** I saw a lot of people’s eyes glaze over. The intention was to have the book pitches written down, but maybe I should have the books on the stands, and the descriptions underneath or something.
- **Change wording of the freebies.** “5 games for $5” instead of “Buy the $5 pamphlet and get the 4 freebies with it.” Or something…
- **I brought WAY too many books with me.** I brought my whole stock, which was like 3 heavy boxes. But I only sold about 5 copies of each book. Going to seriously tone it down next time.

With those things in mind, let's review what I changed.

## The New Setup

*The new hotness*

Let's cover it point by point.

- **I added a box.** Not only does it add some height and give me more display space, but it gives the eye more things to look at. PIZZAZ! Hopefully.
- **Scattered Dice.** Hopefully that will be enough of an indicator to draw the nerds I'm looking for. It also adds a little spice to the setup, hopefully without being overwhelming.
- **Pitch and Prices Posted.** I didn't want to put the prices on the books, and I also didn't want to add MORE text to my setup. So I tried to compress all the text into one place, very clearly posted.

- **Change the Freebies.** I'm no longer going to try and sell them; the pricing was too complex. Now I'm just going to give them away, one per person. Also found a nice plastic holder to display them more cleanly.

- **MTG Tokens.** I stole the idea from [Ben Milton of Questing Beast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V236bemO4jc). I made a few dozen for my own personal use, and they were so popular with my friends that I decided to see if I can sell them. They're more to draw people to the booth than to make any real profit; but still. I hope this adds a little more variety to my table.

*They feel so good to just root around in. Don't look at me like that!*

I hope the new setup is a little simpler while also offering more variety and eye-catching layout. I'll update this post after the convention is over. 

Wish me luck. [**And support our kickstarter**](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/technicalgrimoire/two-rpg-zines-marsh-goons-and-tempered-legacy)!
