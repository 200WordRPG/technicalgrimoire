It's ya boi, coming atcha with another Convention Display Upgrade! I'll be attending [IncredibleCon2021](https://www.incrediblecon.com/) this weekend. Other Convention posts here:

## What about COVID?

I did a lot of hand-wringing about attending this convention during a huge spike of COVID-19 cases. The Delta variant is tearing through my town and I was on the verge of canceling. However IncredibleCon is taking their precautions very seriously, and my wife and I have taken several of our own as well:

 - Masks are required for all attendees (and free masks will be available).
 - They rented another room to spread out panels and vendors.
 - Capacity will be capped at the convention in general and in rooms specifically.
 - Hand Sanitizer will be everywhere.
 - My wife and I are both vaccinated and we both tested negative recently.
 - We'll be behind the booth, keeping safe distances from folks.

Even with all these precautions, I'm still very concerned and honestly a bit guilty. I try to console myself that I'm not making things any worse, even if this is not the best decision. 

But I'm still not sure. Maybe I'll wake up tomorrow and just bail on the entire thing. I hate this pandemic. No matter what I decide, I'll still share some of the planned upgrades I've made to my booth; maybe when this is all over you'll find it useful.

## Version 4: Now with Spear Witch!

![ConV4_shelves.jpg](/images/posts/ConV4_shelves.jpg)

Do note that my table is a foot or two smaller than the convention table will be; so everything will have much more space to breathe.

The shelves are a HUGE upgrade. They look so slick and make it easy to see what books are available. And I needed them to fit all the new books from Spear Witch!

[Spear Witch](https://spearwitch.com/) is my primary distributer. They are incredible to work with and have made my job 10x easier. They handle all my shipping for all my books. I cannot express how much stress and headache they've removed from my life. Thank you Jared! I love you!

So naturally I'm so excited to add some of their products to my display. In particular I'll be selling copies of:

 - [**Catlands Jazzband**](https://spearwitch.com/products/the-catlands-jazzband-gazetter) - $24
A magical setting of Fae cats who stole the power of jazz to lure and delight mortals.
 - [**Empty Sector**](https://spearwitch.com/products/empty-sector) - $18
A sci-fi setting for the Troika RPG. Includes 36 character classes, items, spells, and skills.
 - [**Hexdrive**](https://spearwitch.com/products/hexdrive): Space-fantasy for Troika. Monsters, ships, nebulae, everything else from the cold astral sea.
 - [**Ludicrous Compendium**](https://spearwitch.com/products/the-ludicrous-compendium-first-omnibus-edition) - $15
A poetry bestiary. Each creature entry includes 
a short haiku and a flavorful description. 
 - [**Roustabout**](https://spearwitch.com/products/roustabout) - $12
A game of charming rapscallions and the city in which they dwell. Complete rules included.
 - [**Want To Be An Adventurer?**](https://spearwitch.com/products/so-you-want-to-be-an-adventurer) - $6
An elegant fantasy roleplaying game with room for notes and doodles (LOTS of doodles)!

I'm hoping a wider selection of books will draw more customers in general; both to my books and the Spear Witch books.

Additionally I cleaned up some signage and simplified the display. The prices are listed more clearly beneath the bookshelves, and the tokens don't take up as much space. Freebies are also cleaner and RIGHT under the sign telling customers what to do.

Overall, I'm extremely happy with this new setup. It's way more vertible, looks cleaner, and is easier to absorb and engage with.

## Check Back for Updates

I'll update this post with a report of how the convention went. In case I won't see you at the convention, you can order all these books at [Spear Witch](https://spearwitch.com/). 

Even [Lowcountry Crawl](/lowcountry-crawl) should be available in the next week or so! Get them before they disappear.
